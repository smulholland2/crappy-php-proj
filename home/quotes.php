                "All of our exam results are in and it would be hard to be any happier. We had 143 students in the course of which 141 passed the exam (98.6% pass rate)! As if the pass rate weren't enough reason to rejoice the average score on the test was a 90.8%!  As I've told you before, I did pretty well using the traditional class presentation but I never even came close to this pass rate and exam scores. This is just great. TAP is proving to be a remarkable training tool."<br><br>

We would consider it an advantage for those applicants who want to work in the food business, to have received prior training and certification in food safety and sanitation.

                "I have reviewed a CD-ROM program, Training Achievement Program, that I feel gives our Store Managers the best opportunity to prepare for a food safety manager test.  This program has many benefits, including:<br>
                <ul><li>Fills need for cost effective training to accommodate for high turnover.</li>
                <li>8-12 hours of on-site self-paced, self-teaching Food Safety Certification training.  No offsite training expenses.</li>
                <li>Warranty program greatly increasing first time exam passage.  Saves time and money on re-testing.</li>
                <li>No management time taken for training staff.  No outside trainer’s expenses.  New team members can be effectively trained within days of being hired.</li>
                </ul>My endorsement of the TAP course is from a standpoint of setting our team members up to pass a nationally recognized exam.  I feel any of our team members completing this program with the same integrity required to operate our stores will be successful."<br><br>

                "So far we have acknowledged the best attributes of the new TAP delivery to be:<br>
                <ul><li>The ability to monitor student progress (rather than just hoping our students were reading and studying the textbook, we now can confirm that students are completing their studies)</li>
                <li>The pass rates, we saw in Providence CCA, rose from 67% to 96% (which significantly reduces the number of student who have to arrange to re-take the certification exam)</li>
                <li>Making course achievement and exam passing all one achievement (eliminates the tracking of students who passed the course but didn’t pass the exam)</li>

                "In February we piloted the TAP Food Safety Program for inmate kitchen workers.  As of mid September, we are training four inmates per day.   When we first started the program I would select potential candidates.  It didn't take long before the inmates were approaching me to take the program.  This program works great for us because we are a small facility and the traditional classroom setting would not be feasible."<br><br>

                "I find The Food Safety Manager Certification Training offered through TAP Series to be a comprehensive, interactive training program that helps my students learn essential safety and sanitation information.  The progressive nature of the program requires students to work through all chapters in sequence, further adding to the comprehensive nature of the training.  While I use the TAP program to augment our Quality Food Management course, the TAP program is rigorous enough to be used on its own.  As an instructor, I find the support offered through Tap Series, to be unparalleled.  They answer my every inquiry and request for assistance immediately and completely."<br><br>

                "Just a quick note to let you know how happy I am with the online training lesson we are using for Food Manager Certification and Recertification.  As you know, we have been using your product for one full year now and am proud to report that not one student has failed the exam since I started using your program!!!  Over 200 students tested now.<br><br>In addition, the ease in which I can sign students up for training, especially for recertification where they don’t even have to leave their store to recertify, is awesome.<br><br>
                Thanks again for setting me up with this program, it has saved me tons of time and frustration.

                "I have just completed the TAP Food Safety Manager’s course and I wanted to share my comments. I am in the process of studying for the NEHA RESH/RS certification but my food background was weak.  I thought the course was excellent.  The videos inside the online course were very informative and the exercises were also very helpful.  Both training techniques helped break up the monotony of a normal lecture type training. All in all I think you have an excellent product and I would recommend it to any company that needs to provide training to management personnel in the area of food safety.<br><br>
