                    Courses are purchased as single use enrollments. Each lesson allows up to 5 reviews. After 5 reviews the lesson is closed. Courses are active for 180 days from date of enrollment and will stop functioning 180 days after the enrollment. Within the 180 day active period,  the name of the student can be changed for a $20 fee for all courses except Food Handler, if a TAP Certificate of Achievement has NOT been awarded. Changing of the name will not re-activate any inactive, closed or ended functions. We reserve the right to charge a $5 fee for Food Handler name changes.
