Enrollment rights for Food Safety Manager and most Food Handler courses are already available to the Store Managers. There are some food handler jurisdictions that require extra fees to be purchased by the District Manager. Clicking Place Orders from the Administration Menu will allow District Managers to pay the food handler course fees, which will add enrollment rights for those courses into their district account for their store managers to enroll employees. Enrollment right costs (excluding fees) are billed to Supplier Collaboration Network, no other payment is required at this time.<br>

As designed, proctors are to be at each store. Due to this, DMs need not be examination proctors. If a District Manager chooses to also be an examination proctor, this link will take you to the proctor sign up page. It will take about 2 hours to complete the process. Step by step instructions will be given. There is no cost or special knowledge needed to become a proctor.
